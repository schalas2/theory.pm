  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;ve used Subversion very occasionally <a href="http://justatheory.com/computers/vcs/git/bricolage-svn-to-git.html" title="Just a Theory: “Migrating Bricolage Subversion to Git”">since 2009</a>, and <a href="https://metacpan.org/release/SVN-Notify" title="SVN-Notify on MetaCPAN">SVN::Notify</a> at
all. Over the years, I&rsquo;ve fixed minor issues with it now and then, and made
the a couple of releases to address issues fixed by others. But it&rsquo;s past the
point where I feel qualified to maintain it. Hell, the repository for
SVN::Notify has been <a href="https://github.com/theory/svn-notify/" title="svn-notify Project on GitHub">hosted on GitHub</a> ever <a href="https://github.com/theory/svn-notify/commit/32347ad" title="SVN-Notify Commit: “Note move to GitHub.”">since 2011</a>. I don&rsquo;t have an
instance of Subversion against which to test it; nor do I have any SMTP
servers to throw test messages at.</p>

<p>In short, it&rsquo;s past time I relinquished maintenance of this module to someone
with a vested interest in its continued use. Is that you? Do you need to keep SVN::Notify running for your projects, and have a few <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/tuit" title="Wictionary: “tuit”">TUITs</a> to fix the occasional bug or security issue? If so, drop me a line (david @ this domain). I’d be happy to transfer the repository.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Excerpt from William Mougayar&rsquo;s new book on TechCrunch:</p>

<blockquote><p>At its core, the blockchain is a technology that permanently records transactions in a way that cannot be later erased but can only be sequentially updated, in essence keeping a never-ending historical trail. This seemingly simple functional description has gargantuan implications. It is making us rethink the old ways of creating transactions, storing data, and moving assets, and that’s only the beginning.</p>

<p>The blockchain cannot be described just as a revolution. It is a tsunami-like phenomenon, slowly advancing and gradually enveloping everything along its way by the force of its progression. Plainly, it is the second significant overlay on top of the Internet, just as the Web was that first layer back in 1990. That new layer is mostly about trust, so we could call it the trust layer.</p></blockquote>

<p>What a steaming pile of hype and nonsense. I find it hard to take such revolutionary fervor seriously, as if people forget the Web in the 90s or real estate in 2006. Given that <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/williammougayar">the author is a venture capitalist</a> invested in a <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/openbazaar">blockchain startup</a>, it just feels like a way to try to inflate the value of his investments for short-term gain. A piece like this is snake oil.</p>

<p>Blockchains are inarguably useful tools, like databases or encryption algorithms, and we in the technology business should do our best to understand how thet work and figure out the applications for which they make sense. I’m still trying to wrap my mind around blockchains, but one thing I understand very well: <strong>they&rsquo;re not a panacea.</strong> The industry overall won’t see true benefits from blockchains for a couple of years, once the practicalities have been worked out and the nonsense has subsided. We should learn and contribute to those practicalities, but as for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hype_cycle">hype cycle</a>, for now I just hold my nose.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Glyn Moody, in <em>Ars Technica,</em> on the proposed replacement for the recently
struck-down Safe Harbor framework:</p>

<blockquote><p>However, with what seems like extraordinarily bad timing, President Obama
has just made winning the trust of EU citizens even harder. As
<a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2016/02/obama-administration-closing-in-on-rules-to-let-nsa-share-more-freely-with-fbi-cia/" title="Obama administration closing in on rules to let NSA share more freely with FBI, CIA">Ars reported last week</a>, the Obama administration is close to allowing the
NSA to share more of the private communications it intercepts with other
federal agencies, including the FBI and the CIA, without removing
identifying information first.</p>

<p>In other words, not only will the new Privacy Shield allow the NSA to
continue to scoop up huge quantities of personal data from EU citizens, it
may soon be allowed to share them widely. That&rsquo;s unlikely to go down well
with Europeans, the Article 29 Working Party, or the CJEU&mdash;all of which
ironically increases the likelihood that the new Privacy Shield will suffer
the same fate as the Safe Harbour scheme it has been designed to replace.</p></blockquote>

<p>So let me get this straight. Under this proposal:</p>

<ul>
<li>The NSA can continue to bulk collect EU citizen data.</li>
<li>That data may be shared with other agencies in the US government.</li>
<li>Said collection must fall under six allowed case, one of wich is
undefined &ldquo;counter-terrorism&rdquo; purposes. No one ever abused <em>that</em> kind of
thing before.</li>
<li>The US claims there is no more bulk surveillance, except that there is under those six cases.</li>
<li>The appointed &ldquo;independent ombudsman&rdquo; to address complaints by EU citizens will be a single US Undersecretary of State.</li>
<li>Complaints can also be addressed to US companies housing EU citizen data, even though, in the absence of another Snowden-scale whistle-blowing, they may have no idea their data is being surveilled.</li>
</ul>


<p>Color me skeptical that this would work, let alone not be thrown out by another case similar to the one that killed Safe Harbor.</p>

<p>I have a better idea. How about eliminating mass surveillance?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Paul Roberts in Digital Guardian:</p>

<blockquote><p>Whether or not harm has occurred to plaintiffs is critical for courts to
decide whether the plaintiff has a right – or “standing” – to sue in the
first place. But proving that data exposed in a breach has actually been
used for fraud is notoriously difficult.</p>

<p>In her decision in the Anthem case, [U.S. District Judge Lucy] Koh reasoned
that the theft of personal identification information is harm to consumers
in itself, regardless of whether any subsequent misuse of it can be proven.
Allegations of a “concrete and imminent threat of future harm&#8221; are enough
to establish an injury and standing in the early stages of a breach suit,
she said.</p></blockquote>

<p>Seems like a no-brainer to me. Personal information is just that: <em>personal.</em>
Organizations that collect and store personal information must take every
step they can to protect it. Failure to do so harms their users, exposing
them to increased risk of identity theft, fraud, surveillance, and abuse. It&rsquo;s
reasonable to expect that firms not be insulated from litigation for failing
to protect user data.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Incredible post from Apple, signed by Tim Cook:</p>

<blockquote><p>The government is asking Apple to hack our own users and undermine decades
of security advancements that protect our customers — including tens of
millions of American citizens — from sophisticated hackers and
cybercriminals. The same engineers who built strong encryption into the
iPhone to protect our users would, ironically, be ordered to weaken those
protections and make our users less safe.</p>

<p>We can find no precedent for an American company being forced to expose its
customers to a greater risk of attack. For years, cryptologists and national
security experts have been warning against weakening encryption. Doing so
would hurt only the well-meaning and law-abiding citizens who rely on
companies like Apple to protect their data. Criminals and bad actors will
still encrypt, using tools that are readily available to them.</p></blockquote>

<p>I only wish there was a place to co-sign. Companies must do all they can to
safeguard the privacy of their users, preferably such only users can unlock
and access their personal information. It&rsquo;s in the interest of the government
to ensure that private data remain private. Forcing Apple to crack its own
encryption sets a dangerous precedent likely to be exploited by
cybercriminals for decades to come. Shame on the FBI.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Until last week, I had two newish blogs. This one, <a href="/">theory.pm</a>, was to be my Perl blog. The other one, theory.so, was my database blog. I thought it would be a good idea to have separate blogs for separate audiences, but it turns out I don&rsquo;t post enough to make much difference. And now, as of last week, I let the theory.so domain expire. Control the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.so">.so</a> domain was turned over to Somalia a few months ago, and domain renwal fees went <em>way</em> up. Since I had so few posts over there (14 since August, 2013), I decided it was a good time to just merge it with theory.pm and be done with it.</p>

<p>So my apologies if a bunch of my old posts just showed up in your RSS readers. (You all still use RSS readers, right?). This is a one-time merging of the two blogs, so should not happen again.</p>

<p>Well…maybe. Now I have a total of 25 posts on theory.pm (since July 2013), which is still pretty paltry. I&rsquo;m thinking it&rsquo;s silly to have this thing separate from my original blog, <a href="http://justatheory.com/">Just a Theory</a>, so I might eventually merge that blog, too. Not sure what domain I&rsquo;ll use for it. Maybe I&rsquo;ll go back to justatheory.com. Or maybe I&rsquo;ll use one of the other domains I registered, like the recently added theory.one. Or maybe theory dot something else.</p>

<p>Not that you care. Good on you for reading this far. I would have stopped before now. You&rsquo;re a better person than I.</p>

  </header>



  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="left" src="/images/cpan.png" width="250" height="250" title="'Pod Book'" ></p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve just pushed <a href="https://metacpan.org/release/Pod-Simple/">Pod-Simple</a> 3.29_v3 to CPAN. <a href="https://metacpan.org/author/KHW">Karl Williamson</a> did a lot of
hacking on this release, finally adding support for EBCDIC. But as part of
that work, and in coordination with Pod::Simple&rsquo;s original author, <a href="http://interglacial.com/">Sean
Burke</a>, as well as <a href="http://lists.perl.org/list/pod-people.html">pod-people</a>, we have switched the default encoding from
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_8859-1">Latin-1</a> to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows-1252">CP-1252</a>.</p>

<p>On the surface, that might sound like a big change, but in truth, it&rsquo;s pretty
straight-forward. CP-1252 is effectively a superset of Latin-1, repurposing
30 or so unused control characters from Latin-1. Those characters are pretty
common on Windows (the home of the CP family of encodings), especially in
pastes from Word. It&rsquo;s nice to be able to pick those up essentially for free.</p>

<p>Still, Karl&rsquo;s done more than that. He also updated the encoding detection to
do a better job at detecting UTF-8. This is the <em>real</em> default. Pod::Simple
only falls back on CP1252 if there are no obvious UTF-8 byte sequences in
your Pod.</p>

<p>Overall these changes should be a great improvement. Better encoding support
is always a good idea. But it is a pretty significant change, including a
change to <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/distribution/perl/pod/perlpodspec.pod">the Pod spec</a>. Hence the test release. Please make sure it works
well with your code by installing it today:</p>

<pre><code>cpan D/DW/DWHEELER/Pod-Simple-3.29_3.tar.gz
cpanm DWHEELER/Pod-Simple-3.29_3.tar.gz
</code></pre>

<p>Oh, and one last thing: If Pod::Simple fails to properly recognize the encoding in your Pod file, you can always use the <code>=encoding</code> command early in your Pod file to make it explicit:</p>

<pre><code>=encoding CP1254
</code></pre>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="center" src="/images/ioperllove.png" width="640" title="iovation + Perl = Love" alt="iovation + Perl = Love"></p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve been using the CentOS Perl RPMs at <a href="http://iovation.com/">iovation</a> to run all of our Perl
applications. This has been somewhat painful, because the version of Perl,
5.10.1, is quite old &mdash; it shipped in August 2009. In fact, it consists
mostly of bug fixes against Perl 5.10.0, which shipped in December 2007! Many
of the modules provided by CentOS core and <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL" title="Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux">EPEL</a> are quite old, as well, and
we had built up quite the collection of customized module RPMs managed by a
massive spaghetti-coded Jenkins job. When we recently ran into a Unicode
issue that would best have been addressed by running a more modern Perl &mdash;
rather than a <a href="http://grokbase.com/t/perl/perl5-porters/147gfvrd2n/encode-vs-json#20140723oncbjv4rddo66735xess5wo77a" title="“Encode vs. JSON” on Perl 5 Porters">hinky workaround</a> &mdash; I finally sat down and knocked out a way
to get a solid set of Modern Perl and related CPAN RPMs.</p>

<p>I gave it the rather boring name <code>rpmcpan</code>, and now <a href="https://github.com/iovation/rpmcpan" title="rpmcpan on GitHub">you can use it, too</a>.
Turns out, <a href="http://twitter.com/aaronblew" title="Aaron Blew: SRE Manager (dun dun duuuuun!)">DevOps</a> doesn&rsquo;t myopically insist on using core RPMs in the name
of some abstract idea about stability. Rather, we just need a way to easily
deploy our stuff as RPMs. If the same applies to your organization, you can
get Modern Perl RPMs, too.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s how we do it. We have a new Jenkins job that runs both nightly and
whenever the <a href="https://github.com/iovation/rpmcpan" title="rpmcpan on GitHub"><code>rpmcpan</code> Git repository</a> updates. It uses the <a href="https://metacpan.org/">MetaCPAN</a> API
to build the latest versions of everything we need. Here&rsquo;s how to get it to
build the latest version of Perl, 5.20.1:</p>

<pre><code>./bin/rpmcpan --version 5.20.1
</code></pre>

<p>That will get you a nice, modern Perl RPM, named <code>perl520</code>, completely encapsulated in <code>/usr/local/perl520</code>. Want 5.18 instead: Just change the version:</p>

<pre><code>./bin/rpmcpan --version 5.18.2
</code></pre>

<p>That will give you <code>perl518</code>. But that&rsquo;s not all. You want to build CPAN
distributions against that version. Easy. Just edit the <a href="https://github.com/iovation/rpmcpan/blob/master/etc/dists.json"><code>dists.json</code> file</a>.
Its contents are a JSON object where the keys name CPAN distributions (not
modules), and the values are objects that customize our RPMs get built. Most
of the time, the objects can be empty:</p>

<pre><code>"Try-Tiny": {},
</code></pre>

<p>This results in an RPM named <code>perl520-Try-Tiny</code> (or <code>perl518-Try-Tiny</code>,
etc.). Sometimes you might need additional information to customize the CPAN
spec file generated to build the distribution. For example, since this is
Linux, we need to exclude a Win32 dependency in the <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Encode-Locale" title="Encode-Locale on CPAN">Encode-Locale</a>
distribution:</p>

<pre><code>"Encode-Locale": { "exclude_requires": ["Win32::Console"] },
</code></pre>

<p>Other distributions might require additional RPMs or environment variables,
like <a href="http://search.cpan/org/dist/DBD-Pg/" title="DBD-Pg on CPAN">DBD-Pg</a>, which requires the <a href="http://yum.postgresql.org" title="PostgreSQL Yum Repository">PostgreSQL RPMs</a>:</p>

<pre><code>"DBD-Pg": {
    "build_requires": ["postgresql93-devel", "postgresql93"],
    "environment": { "POSTGRES_HOME": "/usr/pgsql-9.3" }
},
</code></pre>

<p>See the <a href="https://github.com/iovation/rpmcpan/blob/master/README.md" title="`rpmcpan README`">README</a> for a complete list of customization options. Or just get
started with our <a href="https://github.com/iovation/rpmcpan/blob/master/etc/dists.json"><code>dists.json</code> file</a>, which so far builds the bare minimum we
need for one of our Perl apps. Add new distributions? Send a <a href="https://github.com/iovation/rpmcpan/pulls">pull request</a>!
We&rsquo;ll be doing so as we integrate more of our Perl apps with a Modern Perl

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yours truly was feature in this week&rsquo;s episode of <a href="http://twit.tv/floss">FLOSS Weekly</a>, talking
about Sqitch. I feel pretty good about this interview, despite continually
banging on my legs, the table, and the mic. It&rsquo;s interesting to try to
communicate what Sqitch is about purely by talking.</p>
