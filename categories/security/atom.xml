      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Excerpt from William Mougayar&rsquo;s new book on TechCrunch:</p>

<blockquote><p>At its core, the blockchain is a technology that permanently records transactions in a way that cannot be later erased but can only be sequentially updated, in essence keeping a never-ending historical trail. This seemingly simple functional description has gargantuan implications. It is making us rethink the old ways of creating transactions, storing data, and moving assets, and that’s only the beginning.</p>

<p>The blockchain cannot be described just as a revolution. It is a tsunami-like phenomenon, slowly advancing and gradually enveloping everything along its way by the force of its progression. Plainly, it is the second significant overlay on top of the Internet, just as the Web was that first layer back in 1990. That new layer is mostly about trust, so we could call it the trust layer.</p></blockquote>

<p>What a steaming pile of hype and nonsense. I find it hard to take such revolutionary fervor seriously, as if people forget the Web in the 90s or real estate in 2006. Given that <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/williammougayar">the author is a venture capitalist</a> invested in a <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/openbazaar">blockchain startup</a>, it just feels like a way to try to inflate the value of his investments for short-term gain. A piece like this is snake oil.</p>

<p>Blockchains are inarguably useful tools, like databases or encryption algorithms, and we in the technology business should do our best to understand how thet work and figure out the applications for which they make sense. I’m still trying to wrap my mind around blockchains, but one thing I understand very well: <strong>they&rsquo;re not a panacea.</strong> The industry overall won’t see true benefits from blockchains for a couple of years, once the practicalities have been worked out and the nonsense has subsided. We should learn and contribute to those practicalities, but as for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hype_cycle">hype cycle</a>, for now I just hold my nose.</p>

      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Rich Mogull:</p>

<blockquote><p>Don’t be distracted by the technical details. The model of phone, the method
of encryption, the detailed description of the specific attack technique,
and even the feasibility are all irrelevant.</p>

<p>Don’t be distracted by the legal wrangling. By the timing, the courts, or
the laws in question. Nor by politicians, proposed legislation, Snowden, or
speeches at think tanks or universities.</p>

<p>Don’t be distracted by who is involved. Apple, the FBI, dead terrorists, or
common drug dealers.</p>

<p>Everything, all of it, boils down to a single question.</p>

<p><em>Do we have a right to security?</em></p></blockquote>

<p>How about we introduce a bill guaranteeing a right to security. <a href="https://twitter.com/theory/status/700823603122540544">Senator Wyden</a>?</p>

      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Paul Roberts in Digital Guardian:</p>

<blockquote><p>Whether or not harm has occurred to plaintiffs is critical for courts to
decide whether the plaintiff has a right – or “standing” – to sue in the
first place. But proving that data exposed in a breach has actually been
used for fraud is notoriously difficult.</p>

<p>In her decision in the Anthem case, [U.S. District Judge Lucy] Koh reasoned
that the theft of personal identification information is harm to consumers
in itself, regardless of whether any subsequent misuse of it can be proven.
Allegations of a “concrete and imminent threat of future harm" are enough
to establish an injury and standing in the early stages of a breach suit,
she said.</p></blockquote>

<p>Seems like a no-brainer to me. Personal information is just that: <em>personal.</em>
Organizations that collect and store personal information must take every
step they can to protect it. Failure to do so harms their users, exposing
them to increased risk of identity theft, fraud, surveillance, and abuse. It&rsquo;s
reasonable to expect that firms not be insulated from litigation for failing
to protect user data.</p>
