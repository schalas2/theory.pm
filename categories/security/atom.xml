      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Paul Roberts in Digital Guardian:</p>

<blockquote><p>Whether or not harm has occurred to plaintiffs is critical for courts to
decide whether the plaintiff has a right – or “standing” – to sue in the
first place. But proving that data exposed in a breach has actually been
used for fraud is notoriously difficult.</p>

<p>In her decision in the Anthem case, [U.S. District Judge Lucy] Koh reasoned
that the theft of personal identification information is harm to consumers
in itself, regardless of whether any subsequent misuse of it can be proven.
Allegations of a “concrete and imminent threat of future harm" are enough
to establish an injury and standing in the early stages of a breach suit,
she said.</p></blockquote>

<p>Seems like a no-brainer to me. Personal information is just that: <em>personal.</em>
Organizations that collect and store personal information must take every
step they can to protect it. Failure to do so harms their users, exposing
them to increased risk of identity theft, fraud, surveillance, and abuse. It&rsquo;s
reasonable to expect that firms not be insulated from litigation for failing
to protect user data.</p>
