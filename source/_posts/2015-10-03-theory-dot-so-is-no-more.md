Until last week, I had two newish blogs. This one, [theory.pm](/), was to be my Perl blog. The other one, theory.so, was my database blog. I thought it would be a good idea to have separate blogs for separate audiences, but it turns out I don't post enough to make much difference. And now, as of last week, I let the theory.so domain expire. Control the [.so](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.so) domain was turned over to Somalia a few months ago, and domain renwal fees went *way* up. Since I had so few posts over there (14 since August, 2013), I decided it was a good time to just merge it with theory.pm and be done with it.

So my apologies if a bunch of my old posts just showed up in your RSS readers. (You all still use RSS readers, right?). This is a one-time merging of the two blogs, so should not happen again.

Wellâ€¦maybe. Now I have a total of 25 posts on theory.pm (since July 2013), which is still pretty paltry. I'm thinking it's silly to have this thing separate from my original blog, [Just a Theory](http://justatheory.com/), so I might eventually merge that blog, too. Not sure what domain I'll use for it. Maybe I'll go back to justatheory.com. Or maybe I'll use one of the other domains I registered, like the recently added theory.one. Or maybe theory dot something else.

Not that you care. Good on you for reading this far. I would have stopped before now. You're a better person than I.
