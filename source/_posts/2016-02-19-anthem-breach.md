Seems like a no-brainer to me. Personal information is just that: *personal.*
Organizations that collect and store personal information must take every
step they can to protect it. Failure to do so harms their users, exposing
them to increased risk of identity theft, fraud, surveillance, and abuse. It's
reasonable to expect that firms not be insulated from litigation for failing
to protect user data.
