Incredible post from Apple, signed by Tim Cook:

> The government is asking Apple to hack our own users and undermine decades
> of security advancements that protect our customers — including tens of
> millions of American citizens — from sophisticated hackers and
> cybercriminals. The same engineers who built strong encryption into the
> iPhone to protect our users would, ironically, be ordered to weaken those
> protections and make our users less safe.
>
> We can find no precedent for an American company being forced to expose its
> customers to a greater risk of attack. For years, cryptologists and national
> security experts have been warning against weakening encryption. Doing so
> would hurt only the well-meaning and law-abiding citizens who rely on
> companies like Apple to protect their data. Criminals and bad actors will
> still encrypt, using tools that are readily available to them.

I only wish there was a place to co-sign. Companies must do all they can to
safeguard the privacy of their users, preferably such only users can unlock
and access their personal information. It's in the interest of the government
to ensure that private data remain private. Forcing Apple to crack its own
encryption sets a dangerous precedent likely to be exploited by
cybercriminals for decades to come. Shame on the FBI.
