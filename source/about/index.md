Hi, I'm David E. Wheeler, a.k.a. "theory", a.k.a.
[DWHEELER](https://metacpan.org/author/DWHEELER "DWHEELER's CPAN Distributions")
on CPAN. I've been hacking Perl since 1995, when I first started programming.
Perl was my first language, and still my favorite. [theory.pm](/) is my Perl
blog. I also have a [personal blog](http://justatheory.com/ "Just a Theory").
